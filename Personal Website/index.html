      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>I‚Äôm Ayesha, a Computer Science student who likes to keep things straightforward. I enjoy coding, but I‚Äôm also into music, Volleyball, reading, and just relaxing when I can. I don‚Äôt really like overcomplicating things‚Äîif there‚Äôs a clean way to do something, that‚Äôs the route I‚Äôm taking. I like answers that make sense without all the extra, and I‚Äôm always trying to stay ahead, whether it‚Äôs school, life, or anything in between. I think logically, but I‚Äôm also not afraid to be a little different with how I approach stuff.</p>
